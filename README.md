# Oil Production Analysis Dashboard

## üìä Project Overview
This Power BI project is an advanced Oil Production Analysis Dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into oil production patterns, seasonal trends, growth rates, and future forecasts. The dashboard is structured into multiple interactive pages that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and strategize for market demands.

## üéØ Objective
The primary goal of this project is to enable strategic decision-making by visualizing complex oil production data. It offers a holistic view of production trends, growth patterns, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, ensuring businesses can proactively respond to market fluctuations and optimize their operations.

## üìÅ Project Structure
This project consists of four main report pages:

1. Dashboard Page: Provides a high-level overview of total production, monthly and yearly trends, and growth rates. It highlights key metrics such as total production (75M barrels), average production (284K barrels), and peak production periods.

2. Trend Analysis Page: Analyzes production patterns, showing top and bottom-performing months and years. It also compares current vs. previous month production to identify dynamic changes and seasonal impacts.

3. Forecast Page: Utilizes historical data trends to forecast production for the next decade. It includes anomaly detection to identify irregular patterns, enabling proactive risk management.
   
4. Summary & Insights Page: Offers strategic recommendations based on data analysis, guiding stakeholders in optimizing production schedules, addressing anomalies, and aligning operations with forecasted trends.

## üîë Key Features and KPIs

1. Total Oil Production: 75M barrels
2. Average Production: 284K barrels
3. Peak Production: 360K barrels
4. Monthly and Yearly Growth Trends: Identifies high-demand periods for strategic planning.
5. Anomaly Detection: Highlights unusual production patterns for proactive decision-making.
6. Forecasting: Predicts production trends for the next 5 to 10 years, guiding strategic planning.
