# Oil Production Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI project is an advanced Oil Production Analysis Dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into oil production patterns, seasonal trends, growth rates, and future forecasts. The dashboard is structured into multiple interactive pages that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and strategize for market demands.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to enable strategic decision-making by visualizing complex oil production data. It offers a holistic view of production trends, growth patterns, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics, ensuring businesses can proactively respond to market fluctuations and optimize their operations.

## 📁 Project Structure
This project consists of four main report pages:

1. Dashboard Page: Provides a high-level overview of total production, monthly and yearly trends, and growth rates. It highlights key metrics such as total production (75M barrels), average production (284K barrels), and peak production periods.

2. Trend Analysis Page: Analyzes production patterns, showing top and bottom-performing months and years. It also compares current vs. previous month production to identify dynamic changes and seasonal impacts.

3. Forecast Page: Utilizes historical data trends to forecast production for the next decade. It includes anomaly detection to identify irregular patterns, enabling proactive risk management.
   
4. Summary & Insights Page: Offers strategic recommendations based on data analysis, guiding stakeholders in optimizing production schedules, addressing anomalies, and aligning operations with forecasted trends.
